# mCharts

A collection of reusable charts and chart components in d3.js

## In heavy development.  Until version 1.0.0 API may change at any time.

This library is still in the process of being designed. Playing around with
a few ideas. Need to iron out what stays and what goes before developing
more charts. The current ones are there to make sure the structure they are
done in is viable.

## DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION
